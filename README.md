# Teenpsy Ai
Our artificial intelligence project offers a solution that focuses on mental health by analyzing users' interaction with social media content.


Note: The prototype has only been tested on Python 3.9.12.


## Prerequisites
You have to have:
- Python 3.9 installed on your system
- the requirements installed
```bash
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- the OpenAI API key on main.py line 15 replaced with your own


## Usage

* First, you have to turn on the developer mode for chrome extensions and add the extension folder by using the "load an unpacked extension" option. It is recommended to have it pinned to make accessing easier.

* Secondly, you need to run main.py to initialize flask server
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

* Finally, you need to open the user interface from `panel/panel.html`
